The potential instability of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and its contribution to global and regional sea level during warm climates, is a critical question in regards to both past interglacials and future sea-level change. We present results from an ongoing project (the ERC-funded RISeR project) which seeks to exploit the sea-level fingerprint of the Antarctic ice sheet during the Last Interglacial, to understand how much and how fast sea level has risen as a result of ice-sheet melt during a time when polar temperatures were similar to those predicted for the future. We combine offshore seismic reflection data with five new boreholes collected from the southern North Sea and innovative sedimentological analysis, alongside ice sheet and glacial isostatic adjustment modelling, to strive to improve our understanding of the magnitudes and uncertainty in the Antarctic ice sheet contribution to regional Last Interglacial sea-level highstands. 
  
Here we present our preliminary analysis of the sediment cores; including X-ray laminography, MSCL-XYZ, and XRF (ITRAX) data. We outline our plans to develop robust age-depth models for the individual cores, with the aim of improving constraints on the rate of relative sea-level change during the Last Interglacial. In the future,these results will inform long-term high-risk, low-probability sea-level projections.
