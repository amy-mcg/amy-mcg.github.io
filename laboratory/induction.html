<p>This document provides basic information about use of Level 7 Field and Teaching Lab in the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds, including Room 7.114, 7.114a, and 7.114b.</p>
<p>Once you have completed the induction process you will then be allowed to use the laboratory within normal working hours with lab manager approval (9am-5pm).</p>
<p>Lab Manager: Bob Jamieson (R.A.Jamieson@leeds.ac.uk)</p>

<h3>Fire and emergency</h3>
<p>You are never expected to tackle a fire. Setting off the alarm is the first priority in the event of a fire.</p>
<b>Fire warden</b>
<p>The Fire Warden for Level 7 is Stephen Burgess; Room 7.105</p>
<b>Fire extinguishers</b>
<p>Foam and CO2 extinguishers are available in the corridor opposite Room 7.108. Only use the extinguisher if you are confident to do so and know which type to use. CO2 for electrical and foam for flammable materials.</p>
<b>Alarms</b>
If an alarm sounds, either in the lab you are in or another one, DO NOT ignore it; report it to the technicians or the staff identified on door. DO NOT attempt to deal with it yourself. Leave the building and go to the fire assembly point (Chancellor’s Court).
<b>Emergency shutdown procedures</b>
<p>In the event of a fire or other emergency, make your work area safe by;<br>
Closing all containers and reagent bottles etc.<br>
Turn off hotplates and other items of equipment.<br>
Close the sash on fume cupboards.<br>
Turn the natural gas off using yellow valve in your workspace and the large red button near the door. </p>
<h3>Health and safety overview</h3>
<p>The basic rules of the laboratory are:<br>
<ul>
<li>Wear your lab coats and safety glasses at all times</li>
<li>Do not eat or drink within the lab, do not keep food or drink in the lab</li>
<li>Keep your work area clean and tidy, wipe up spills immediately and work on the trays provided</li>
<li>If you are handling samples or chemicals you should wear appropriate chemical resistant gloves</li>
<li>Never work alone</li>
</ul>
<p>Normal prescription glasses are not a substitute for lab glasses. You must either wear safety glasses on top of your prescription glasses or get special prescription lab glasses. </p>
<p>Do not touch door handles, computers, or telephones with gloves on. This is a health and safety risk and risks the cross contamination of yours, and other users, samples and skin.</p>
<b>Dress code</b><ul>
<li>Work shirt that covers the upper torso and arms</li>
<li>Lower body clothing that covers the entire leg to the ankle (e.g., pants, skirt, coveralls, lab coat) and fully protects exposed skin</li>
<li>Closed-toe shoes that cover the top of the foot and are made of leather or synthetic leather or another material that resists rapid penetration by spilled liquids or sharps</li>
</ul>
<h3>First aid</h3>
<b>All accidents must be reported.</b>
The first aiders for level 7 are Crispin Little (Room 7.109) and Robert Jamieson (Room 9.163)<br>
There is a first aid kit located on top of the cabinets by the balances in 7.144. If the first aider is not available then contact the following:<ul>
<li>Reception (office hours) 0113 343 2846</li>
<li>Security (out of hours) 0113 343 5494</li>
<li>Emergency 0113 343 2222</li>
  </ul>
<b>Eye wash</b>
<p>Eyewash hoses are located next to every sink.
If you need to use the eye wash, call for help. Wash the affected eye in away from the other eye so the chemical is not transferred from one eye to the other.
Do not stack glassware or other equipment around the eyewash as access to the eyewash must be kept clear at all times. 
If you can avoid wearing contact lenses please do so as they make effectively washing out your eyes more difficult. If you do have to wear them, make sure they are removed after an accident.</p>
<b>Spillages</b>
If in doubt, get help.
What to do if you spill something
If you cause a spill it is your responsibility to ensure it is cleaned up. However, only tackle spills if you are comfortable doing so and have had the appropriate training. The spill kit is located under the sink in 7.114b, and extra spills equipment is stored in the Cohen Labs on Lvl 9. 
In the event of a chemical spill:<ol>
<li>Instruct others to keep at a safe distance, well away from the spillage area</li>
<li>Decide if you are trained, knowledgeable and equipped to handle the incident. Never proceed to clean up a spill if you do not know the hazards associated with the chemical or if you are unsure of how to clean up the spill</li>
  <li>If anyone is injured or contaminated, immediately notify one of the emergency contacts and, if trained, begin decontamination measures or first aid</li>
  <li>Consider evacuation of building if spillage is serious (use fire alarm for this purpose)</li></ol>
<b>Paperwork</b>
<p>Anything is possible – with the right paperwork!</p>
<p>Many of the procedures in the laboratory already have paperwork (SOP and RA) in place. Please check before writing new documents, just in case.</p>
<b>Required paperwork</b>
<p>This paperwork may have been prepared for you or you may have to complete it yourself. Check with your supervisor/manager. The minimum you should complete is a Risk Assessment (RA). You may also need to complete:</p><ul>
<li>COSHH assessment(s)</li>
<li>Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) or Method</li>  
<li>Biological risk assessment</li>
<li>Manual handling risk assessment</li>
</ul>
<p>They must be signed by you and your supervisor/manager then placed in the plastic wallets on the walls either side of the sink in 7.114a (or in the documentation folder in the main lab).</p>
<p>Absolutely <b>NO</b> work is permitted in the lab without you actively discussing, and agreeing, any laboratory procedures with your supervisor and the lab manager. You will then fill out your own paperwork and give a signed copy to the lab manager. There are no exceptions to this rule.</p>
<b>Out of hours / lone working</b>
<p>Never lone work!</p>
<p>Out of hours working is defined as anything outside 9am-5pm, Monday to Friday during normal University operating dates. Lone working is working in an isolated area where there is not someone in shouting distance. Out of hours working counts as lone working and so you must follow certain procedures for both. </p>
If you are required to work out of hours / lone work: <ol>
  <li>You need to have completed either a lone work risk assessment or have included a detailed out of hours working assessment on your original risk assessment for the work you are doing</li>
  <li>You should have a buddy, that is someone who knows where you are and who you can call to tell them you have left – they must also have access to the building and laboratory</li>
  <li>You should fill in the log book outside reception, you should log in AND OUT. This so in the case of a fire so the fire brigade know you are in the building. So if you are going to stay late at 5pm you need to go down to reception and fill in the book</li>
</ol>
When working out of hours or when no one else is in the L7 lab suite:<ul>
  <li>Do not handle concentrated reagents and material. Prepared diluted stock reagents earlier in the day for later use</li>
  <li>See notes on fume cupboards with regard ventilation</li>
  <li>See guidance on lone working on the SEE sharepoint</li>
</ul>
<h3>Monthly lab clean</h3>
<p>Lab cleaning normally occurs on the last Wednesday of the month. It is an opportunity for all laboratory users to clean and tidy not just their work area but the labs in general. Attendance at lab cleaning is a priority and we expect you be present unless you have a good excuse.</p>
<h3>Laboratory usage</h3>
<p>If you break something, let the lab manager know. Accidents happen, however it’s important the lab manager is informed so they can rectify the situation.</p>
<b>Glassware</b>
<p>Do not assume that anything found in the cupboards is analytically clean. As we are not a geochemistry lab glassware on shelves is not required to be acid washed. This means that you must acid wash all glassware (except to volumetric glassware) before use if necessary. Please see a technician for training in how to do this. Always return to a cupboard once you have cleaned it.<br>
DO NOT wash any volumetric glassware in an acid bath or dry in an oven - this will degrade its accuracy.
Wash labware following one of these two methods:</p><ol>
  <li>If used for preparing low concentration solutions just rinse 5 times with tap water followed by 5 times with DI water </li>
  <li>Glassware and plasticware should not be moved between labs as this could lead to cross contamination of samples</li>
</ol>
<p>If you require specialist glassware ask the lab manager.</p>
<b>Balances</b>
<p>Balances are the very important pieces of lab equipment so please treat them with respect. If a balance is not working properly then any experiments using samples weighed out using it will be flawed and your results incorrect. Please clean balances after use. Please ask for training on how to do this.</p>
<b>Other lab equipment</b>
<p>All other lab equipment has a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), please ask the lab manager if you require training to use any piece of laboratory equipment you have not used previously.</p>
<h3>Samples and chemicals</h3>
<b>Natural samples</b>
<p>Be aware of what is in your samples, and label them accordingly. You should know if they are likely to be a danger to lab users (e.g. toxic). You should also ensure others working in your lab are aware if they are dangerous. All natural samples should be stored in sealed containers that are clearly labelled. Samples that spills from a container could contaminate your and others work. Samples should be put away in your cupboard after use and not left on the bench. Spillages should be dealt with immediately.</p>
<p>When you have finished preparing/analysing sample materials it is your responsibility to store them. Samples should not be left in the field lab long term, and will be disposed of accordingly.</p>
<b>Samples from outside the UK </b>
<p>If you are going to bring soil samples from outside the UK please ensure you have discussed with faculty H&S to ensure they are registered.</p>
<b>Chemicals</b>
<p>After you use chemicals they should be put back in the appropriate storage area. Chemicals should be correctly labelled with concentration if appropriate. Spillages should be dealt with immediately. If handling concentrated acids:</p><ol>
  <li>Double glove, ideally with a neoprene (thicker) glove on top of a nitrile glove</li>
  <li>For small quantities two nitrile gloves is acceptable</li>
  <li>Please only handle concentrated acids in a fume cupboard (which is switched on!)</li>
  <li>Avoid using mechanical pipettes for concentrated acids where possible </li>
  <li>Please make sure any spillages and cleaned up or reported if you do not feel comfortable cleaning them up yourself (or if the spillage is significant)</li>
</ol>
<b>Transporting</b>
<p>When transporting chemicals (between labs or out of the labs) the minimum containment is a sealed container. Where large volumes or dangerous materials are being transported (i.e. concentrated acid) secondary containment is vital. </p>
<p>Please ensure that containment is suitable to the chemical being transported. Large acid bottles must be transported using an acid carrier.</p> 
<b>Labelling samples</b>
LABEL IT OR LOSE IT!<br>
<p>Label all chemicals, solutions and samples with name, date, content, concentration, and associated hazards (“Site 4 Sample 2” IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH). There are small sample label cards to use with large batches of samples provided on the left hand side of the sink in 7.114b.</p>
<p>Please consider your disposal date and procedure before undertaking any lab work. If you leave us without a disposal plan in place, we will not know whether to dispose of the sample or if it needs keeping for another researcher. Also, it allows us to deal with disposal and any spillage appropriately.</p>
Disposal procedures include:<ol>
  <li>Can be disposed of down sink</li>
  <li>Can be disposed of in orange (or yellow) bags</li>
  <li>Must be disposed of as liquid waste</li>
</ol>
<h3>Fume cupboards</h3>
<p>You have to turn them on AND OFF.</p>
<p>There are fume cupboards in most labs. They are used for the preparation of toxic, corrosive and/or volatile substances and are designed to protect you from these materials. When properly maintained and used they should do so well.</p>
<p>The fume cupboards have three operation modes all of which pull out air and give the impression that they are on. The fume cupboard is only truly on and safe to use in the “ON” mode.</p>
<p>Occupancy: This setting operates between 8am and 8pm and enough air is removed to ensure good ventilation of the lab for normal bench work. The sash should be down and the controller turned off.</p>
<p>Night time setback: This is the energy saving mode used between 8pm and 8am when only 20% of occupancy air is pulled out. The sash should be down and the controller turned off.</p>
<p>ON: This is the full experimental mode and for use when the activities are being carried out in the fume cupboard. Unless this mode is turned off again it will remain on 24 hours a day 7 days a week so please remember to turn them off when they are not in use.</p>
<p>To switch the fume cupboard ON press the “I” button on the panel on the top left corner. The fume cupboard display will now show “EXT ON”.</p>
<p>You should work with the sash as low as practically possible as it provides a physical barrier that protects you from explosions, spills, and splashes.</p>
<p>Ordinary tap water is provided in the fume cupboard via the green tap. This is not DI water!</p>
<p>Natural gas is provided in the fume cupboard via the yellow tap (for instructions on how to use the natural gas, see above large red button near the lab door). Do not use this without training from a member of technical staff.</p>
<p>In the event of low air flow in the fume cupboard a beeping alarm will sound. Close the sash and leave it for 30 seconds to allow the air flow to pick up again, wait for 2 minutes before continuing work to ensure there is no further problem. Report this to the Technicians and inform fellow users in other labs!</p>
<h3>Fridge space</h3>
<p>Remove your samples when you are finished. Unclaimed samples will be summarily disposed of during the monthly lab cleaning. There are no exceptions.
Any sample that you place in a fridge or a freezer must be labelled according to labelling rules (see above). Please remember to remove samples once you have finished with them.</p>
<h3>Waste</h3>
<p>If in doubt, ask!</p>
<p>There are several types of waste created in the labs. These are summarised below. All lab users are expected to share the responsibility of disposing of waste safely. DO NOT just leave it for someone else to deal with.</p>
<b>General waste</b>
<p>Uncontaminated regular waste (e.g. notepaper, used pens, hand towels) can go in a regular bin (or appropriate recycling bin).</p>
<b>Laboratory Waste</b>
<p>Laboratory waste goes into orange waste bags. Packaging that cannot be identified as lab based (e.g. expanded polystyrene) and is clean (not contaminated) should be recycled in the bins in the corridor.</p>
<b>Sharps</b>
<p>Needles, blades, and small bits of broken glass etc., must go into a “sharps” bin. These will be clearly labelled as sharps bins and are generally yellow plastic with orange lids. Once full, follow the instructions on the bin to seal them and put them into the orange bag or if they are large attach a waste tag and treat them like orange bags (i.e. take them to the bin store - Andy Hobson, Cohen Laboratories Manager, has the key).</p>
<b>Pointy plastics</b>
<p>This is anything that will pierce the thin orange bags but which aren’t proper sharps, e.g., pipette tips, syringes etc. 
These “pointy plastics” are disposed of into a “pointy plastics” bin (in most labs a cardboard box) which is lined with an orange bag. When full, the bag is removed and placed inside another orange bag, ready for disposal.</p>
<b>Orange bag waste (all of the above)</b>
When an orange bag is full, you must:<ul>
<li>Ensure the waste is double bagged</li>
  <li>Tie using one of the tags provided</li>
  <li>Record the tag number in the logbook located in the level 9 corridor</li>
  <li>Collect the clinical waste key from 9.133 (Andy Hobson)</li>
  <li>Disposed of in the orange waste skips next to the bike racks behind Priestley</li>
  <li>Record the tag number in the log book by the orange waste skips</li>
  <li>Return the clinical waste key to 9.133</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be shown this as part of your induction, if you have any questions please speak to the lab manager.</p>
<b>Broken glass</b>
<p>Clean and unlabelled broken glass goes into the cardboard broken glass bins. Final disposal is in the appropriate skip in the brown zone car park.
Contaminated broken glass can go into any sharps bin. Please ask if the glass will not fit into the sharps bins. </p>
<b>Bottles for liquids</b>
<p>Once 2.5 L chemical bottles are empty, ensure the labels are unreadable and rinse three times with tap water. Place in the stock room under the left hand sink in 7.114 to be reused for waste.</p>
<p>When using bottles to store waste please ensure that you check that plastic is suitable for your waste. You may need a glass one, e.g. for halogenated waste.</p>
<b>Containers for solids</b>
<p>Once they are empty, ensure the labels are unreadable and rinse three times with tap water. Then place in the appropriate recycling bin.</p>
<b>Liquid chemical waste</b>
<p>Only dispose of chemical waste down the sink if your COSHH assessment permits you to so. Only use a fume cupboard sink and ensure that it is flushed with copious amounts of water. If your COSHH assessment DOES NOT permit you to dispose of chemical waste down the sink then it must be collected in 2.5L containers or 25L drums.
Label the container with what you have put inside (concentration and volume), the risk phrase and your name and date using the appropriate form. </p>
<b>Solid chemical waste</b>
<p>Collect solid chemical waste in a suitable container and clearly labelled with your name, date, and concentration of what it contains using the appropriate form. Include the hazards relating to those chemicals. See the SOP if you are unsure of what to do.</p>
<b>Biological waste</b>
<p>It is permitted to dispose of biological waste up to and including class 2 materials in the orange bags. </p>
<b>Licensed (overseas) material</b>
<p>All licensed material must be disposed of via the yellow rather than orange bags. If you work with licensed material you must work in accordance with the SEE guidance for licensed material. Speak to the lab manager for further guidance.</p>
