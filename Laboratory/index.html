        4.	Sieve at 125 or 80 μm, using a new (uncontaminated) mesh washing through using tap water into a clean 1 l borosilicate beaker. For clay rich samples, a small amount of detergent can be added to aid deflocculation
        5.	Sieve the < 125 or 80 μm fraction, now in the beaker, at 25 or 15 μm
