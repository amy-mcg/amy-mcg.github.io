          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            <h4>Bio</h4>
            <p>I come from a big ol' Irish family. My home is small village called Kilcar in rural Donegal, but I lived much of my early life on the sunny south coast of England. </p>
            <p>As you can imagine, the sea is my happy place. When I'm not in the lab or in the field I am usually swimming. If you would like to read more about my aquatic adventures I have a rarely updated <a href="https://cantseeland.wordpress.com/">swimming blog</a>. Alternatively you may find me at St. Mary's as, having had a season ticket from the age of 7, I for some reason remain a Southampton FC fan and I suspect it may be too late to change my allegiances. </p>
            <p>My other interests include watching cricket, and listening to cricket, and badly playing cricket. During the COVID pandemic I got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tDrBkOATHc&t=22586s">shout out on TMS</a> and it is still one of my favourite things to have ever happened.</p>
            <p>Although I claim to only like sad indie music I'm actually fairly eclectic in my tastes - sometimes I even listen to happy indie music. You can get far too much information about my past, current and, eventually, future music taste by digging into my <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/amysfc">last.fm</a> account.</p>
            <p>As someone who studies climate change, it is impossible to be apolitical. My politics, however, are not exclusively environmental. First and foremost, I am a socialist, and believe the ongoing climate crisis is a product of our fundamentally flawed economic system which continuously places profit before people and planet. If you would like to argue with me you can find me on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/amymcg.bsky.social">bluesky</a>, or if you just want to shout into the void you can tell me off on the website formerly known as <a href ="https://twitter.com/amymcg/">twitter</a>.</p>
          </p>
          <p class=""lead>
            <h4>Website</h4>
            <p>I made this website from scratch using skills I developed as a teenager messing around on myspace, and a lot of help from the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll website</a>.</p>
            <p>The gifs on the homepage I made myself, using a combination of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator alongside a good deal of stubborness. The graphics on the home page were created by ChatGPT, using prompts such as "generate image of a fountain pen and notepad in the style of a japanese watercolour painting with the colour palette #654ea3 #eaafc8" as I have decided sometimes I don't need to break myself when a tool exists that can do it more efficiently. I do plan to carbon offset my AI usage annually, check my blog to see if I follow through on that.</p> 
            <p>If you would like to use this website as a template do feel free, the full code is available openly on my <a href="https://github.com/amy-mcg/amy-mcg.github.io">github repo</a>. I would appreciate credit where credit is due, however life is too short to track you down, so do feel free to just steal.</p>
